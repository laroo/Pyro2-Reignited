First iteration:

Write a HTML/JS game clone of Pyro 2 (PC Game, 1990). Basically you see a 2d floor map with walls and rooms. Goal is to lay down a fuse and drop fire bombs along the fuse. When the fire bombs explode it will burn down near walls. Score is calculated on how many walls are burned down

2nd:

Basic game mechanics work great. Instead of laying the fuse make that will will be automatically layed when the user walks in a line. When key 'f' is pressed the fuse will start igniting from the beginning and slowly burn down the whole layed down fuse and bombs will explode when the fuse burns near them
