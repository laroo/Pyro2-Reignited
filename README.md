First iteration:

Write a HTML/JS game clone of Pyro 2 (PC Game, 1990). Basically you see a 2d floor map with walls and rooms. Goal is to lay down a fuse and drop fire bombs along the fuse. When the fire bombs explode it will burn down near walls. Score is calculated on how many walls are burned down

2nd:

Basic game mechanics work great. Instead of laying the fuse make that will will be automatically layed when the user walks in a line. When key 'f' is pressed the fuse will start igniting from the beginning and slowly burn down the whole layed down fuse and bombs will explode when the fuse burns near them

3rd

Make the bombs gas cans where the gas will spread through between the walls. Once the fuse hits the gas it will burn down the adjacent walls. These ignited walls will keep burning until there is no direct connected walls anymore. This makes the destruction more extreme. Keep score on how many wall blocks are burned and show a percentage of burned wall blocks and totaal wall blocks
